no it was n't black monday 
 but while the new york stock exchange did n't fall apart friday as the dow jones industrial average plunged N points most of it in the final hour it barely managed to stay this side of chaos 
 some circuit breakers installed after the october N crash failed their first test traders say unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures 
 the N stock specialist firms on the big board floor the buyers and sellers of last resort who were criticized after the N crash once again could n't handle the selling pressure 
 big investment banks refused to step up to the plate to support the beleaguered floor traders by buying big blocks of stock traders say 
 heavy selling of standard & poor 's 500-stock index futures in chicago <unk> beat stocks downward

 the <unk> has already begun 
 the equity market was <unk> 
 once again the specialists were not able to handle the imbalances on the floor of the new york stock exchange said christopher <unk> senior vice president at <unk> securities corp 
 <unk> james <unk> chairman of specialists henderson brothers inc. it is easy to say the specialist is n't doing his job 
 when the dollar is in a <unk> even central banks ca n't stop it 
 speculators are calling for a degree of liquidity that is not there in the market 
 many money managers and some traders had already left their offices early friday afternoon on a warm autumn day because the stock market was so quiet 
 then in a <unk> plunge the dow jones industrials in barely an hour surrendered about a third of their gains this year <unk> up a 190.58-point or N N loss on the day in <unk> trading volume 
 <unk> trading accelerated to N million shares a record for the big board 
 at the end of the day N million shares were traded 
 the dow jones industrials closed at N 
 the dow 's decline was second in point terms only to the <unk> black monday crash that occurred oct. N N 
 in percentage terms however the dow 's dive was the <unk> ever and the sharpest since the market fell N or N N a week after black monday 
 the dow fell N N on black monday 
 shares of ual the parent of united airlines were extremely active all day friday reacting to news and rumors about the proposed $ N billion buy-out of the airline by an <unk> group 
 wall street 's takeover-stock speculators or risk arbitragers had placed unusually large bets that a takeover would succeed and ual stock would rise 
 at N p.m. edt came the <unk> news the big board was <unk> trading in ual pending news 
 on the exchange floor as soon as ual stopped trading we <unk> for a panic said one top floor trader 
 several traders could be seen shaking their heads when the news <unk> 
 for weeks the market had been nervous about takeovers after campeau corp. 's cash crunch spurred concern about the prospects for future highly leveraged takeovers 
 and N minutes after the ual trading halt came news that the ual group could n't get financing for its bid 
 at this point the dow was down about N points 
 the market <unk> 
 arbitragers could n't dump their ual stock but they rid themselves of nearly every rumor stock they had 
 for example their selling caused trading halts to be declared in usair group which closed down N N to N N delta air lines which fell N N to N N and <unk> industries which sank N to N N 
 these stocks eventually reopened 
 but as panic spread speculators began to sell blue-chip stocks such as philip morris and international business machines to offset their losses 
 when trading was halted in philip morris the stock was trading at N down N N while ibm closed N N lower at N 
 selling <unk> because of waves of automatic stop-loss orders which are triggered by computer when prices fall to certain levels 
 most of the stock selling pressure came from wall street professionals including computer-guided program traders 
 traders said most of their major institutional investors on the other hand sat tight 
 now at N one of the market 's post-crash reforms took hold as the s&p N futures contract had plunged N points equivalent to around a <unk> drop in the dow industrials 
 under an agreement signed by the big board and the chicago mercantile exchange trading was temporarily halted in chicago 
 after the trading halt in the s&p N pit in chicago waves of selling continued to hit stocks themselves on the big board and specialists continued to <unk> prices down 
 as a result the link between the futures and stock markets <unk> apart 
 without the <unk> of stock-index futures the barometer of where traders think the overall stock market is headed many traders were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the big board 
 the futures halt was even <unk> by big board floor traders 
 it <unk> things up said one major specialist 
 this confusion effectively halted one form of program trading stock index arbitrage that closely links the futures and stock markets and has been blamed by some for the market 's big swings 
 in a stock-index arbitrage sell program traders buy or sell big baskets of stocks and offset the trade in futures to lock in a price difference 
 when the airline information came through it <unk> every model we had for the marketplace said a managing director at one of the largest program-trading firms 
 we did n't even get a chance to do the programs we wanted to do 
 but stocks kept falling 
 the dow industrials were down N points at N p.m. before the <unk> halt 
 at N p.m. at the end of the cooling off period the average was down N points 
 meanwhile during the the s&p trading halt s&p futures sell orders began <unk> up while stocks in new york kept falling sharply 
 big board chairman john j. phelan said yesterday the circuit breaker worked well <unk> 
 i just think it 's <unk> at this point to get into a debate if index arbitrage would have helped or hurt things 
 under another post-crash system big board president richard <unk> mr. phelan was flying to <unk> as the market was falling was talking on an <unk> hot line to the other exchanges the securities and exchange commission and the federal reserve board 
 he <unk> out at a high-tech <unk> center on the floor of the big board where he could watch <unk> on prices and pending stock orders 
 at about N p.m. edt s&p futures resumed trading and for a brief time the futures and stock markets started to come back in line 
 buyers stepped in to the futures pit 
 but the <unk> of s&p futures sell orders weighed on the market and the link with stocks began to fray again 
 at about N the s&p market <unk> to still another limit of N points down and trading was locked again 
 futures traders say the s&p was <unk> that the dow could fall as much as N points 
 during this time small investors began ringing their brokers wondering whether another crash had begun 
 at prudential-bache securities inc. which is trying to cater to small investors some <unk> brokers thought this would be the final <unk> 
 that 's when george l. ball chairman of the prudential insurance co. of america unit took to the internal <unk> system to declare that the plunge was only mechanical 
 i have a <unk> that this particular decline today is something more <unk> about less 
 it would be my <unk> to advise clients not to sell to look for an opportunity to buy mr. ball told the brokers 
 at merrill lynch & co. the nation 's biggest brokerage firm a news release was prepared <unk> merrill lynch comments on market drop 
 the release cautioned that there are significant differences between the current environment and that of october N and that there are still attractive investment opportunities in the stock market 
 however jeffrey b. lane president of shearson lehman hutton inc. said that friday 's plunge is going to set back relations with customers because it <unk> the concern of volatility 
 and i think a lot of people will <unk> on program trading 
 it 's going to bring the debate right back to the <unk> 
 as the dow average ground to its final N loss friday the s&p pit stayed locked at its <unk> trading limit 
 jeffrey <unk> of program trader <unk> investment group said N s&p contracts were for sale on the close the equivalent of $ N million in stock 
 but there were no buyers 
 while friday 's debacle involved mainly professional traders rather than investors it left the market vulnerable to continued selling this morning traders said 
 stock-index futures contracts settled at much lower prices than indexes of the stock market itself 
 at those levels stocks are set up to be <unk> by index arbitragers who lock in profits by buying futures when futures prices fall and simultaneously sell off stocks 
 but nobody knows at what level the futures and stocks will open today 
 the <unk> between the stock and futures markets friday will undoubtedly cause renewed debate about whether wall street is properly prepared for another crash situation 
 the big board 's mr. <unk> said our <unk> performance was good 
 but the exchange will look at the performance of all specialists in all stocks 
 obviously we 'll take a close look at any situation in which we think the <unk> obligations were n't met he said

 ports of call inc. reached agreements to sell its remaining seven aircraft to buyers that were n't disclosed 
 the agreements bring to a total of nine the number of planes the travel company has sold this year as part of a restructuring 
 the company said a portion of the $ N million realized from the sales will be used to repay its bank debt and other obligations resulting from the currently suspended <unk> operations 
 earlier the company announced it would sell its aging fleet of boeing co. <unk> because of increasing maintenance costs 
 a consortium of private investors operating as <unk> funding co. said it has made a $ N million cash bid for most of l.j. hooker corp. 's real-estate and <unk> holdings 
 the $ N million bid includes the assumption of an estimated $ N million in secured liabilities on those properties according to those making the bid 
 the group is led by jay <unk> chief executive officer of <unk> investment corp. in <unk> and a. boyd simpson chief executive of the atlanta-based simpson organization inc 
 mr. <unk> 's company specializes in commercial real-estate investment and claims to have $ N billion in assets mr. simpson is a developer and a former senior executive ing companies that would be formed under the country 's plan to <unk> its massive water and electric utilities 
 britain 's government plans to raise about # N billion $ N billion from the sale of most of its giant water and electric utilities beginning next month 
 the planned electric utility sale scheduled for next year is alone expected to raise # N billion making it the world 's largest public offering 
 under terms of the plan independent <unk> would be able to compete for N N of customers until N and for another N N between N and N 
 canadian utilities had N revenue of c$ N billion mainly from its natural gas and electric utility businesses in alberta where the company serves about N customers 
 there seems to be a move around the world to <unk> the generation of electricity mr. <unk> said and canadian utilities hopes to capitalize on it 
 this is a real thrust on our utility side he said adding that canadian utilities is also <unk> projects in <unk> countries though he would be specific 
 canadian utilities is n't alone in exploring power generation opportunities in britain in anticipation of the privatization program 
 we 're certainly looking at some power generating projects in england said bruce <unk> vice president corporate strategy and corporate planning with enron corp. houston a big natural gas producer and pipeline operator 
 mr. <unk> said enron is considering building <unk> power plants in the u.k. capable of producing about N <unk> of power at a cost of about $ N million to $ N million 
 pse inc. said it expects to report third earnings of $ N million to $ N million or N cents to N cents a share 
 in the year-ago quarter the designer and operator of <unk> and waste heat recovery plants had net income of $ N or four cents a share on revenue of about $ N million 
 the company said the improvement is related to additional <unk> facilities that have been put into operation

 <unk> & broad home corp. said it formed a $ N million limited partnership subsidiary to buy land in california suitable for residential development 
 the partnership <unk> & broad land development venture limited partnership is a N joint venture with a trust created by institutional clients of <unk> advisory corp. a unit of <unk> financial corp. a real estate advisory management and development company with offices in chicago and beverly hills calif 
 <unk> & broad a home building company declined to identify the institutional investors 
 the land to be purchased by the joint venture has n't yet received <unk> and other approvals required for development and part of <unk> & broad 's job will be to obtain such approvals 
 the partnership runs the risk that it may not get the approvals for development but in return it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices which can result in sizable savings said bruce <unk> president and chief executive officer of <unk> & broad 
 there are really very few companies that have adequate capital to buy properties in a raw state for cash 
 typically developers option property and then once they get the administrative approvals they buy it said mr. <unk> adding that he believes the joint venture is the first of its kind 
 we usually operate in that conservative manner 
 by setting up the joint venture <unk> & broad can take the more aggressive approach of buying raw land while avoiding the negative <unk> to its own balance sheet mr. <unk> said 
 the company is putting up only N N of the capital although it is responsible for providing management planning and processing services to the joint venture 
 this is one of the best ways to assure a pipeline of land to fuel our growth at a minimum risk to our company mr. <unk> said 
 when the price of plastics took off in N quantum chemical corp. went along for the ride 
 the timing of quantum 's chief executive officer john <unk> <unk> appeared to be nothing less than inspired because he had just increased quantum 's reliance on plastics 
 the company <unk> much of the chemical industry as annual profit grew <unk> in two years 
 mr. <unk> said of the boom it 's going to last a whole lot longer than anybody thinks 
 but now prices have <unk> and quantum 's profit is <unk> 
 some securities analysts are looking for no better than break-even results from the company for the third quarter compared with year-earlier profit of $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N million 
 the stock having lost nearly a quarter of its value since sept. N closed at $ N share down $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading friday 
 to a degree quantum represents the new times that have arrived for producers of the so-called commodity plastics that <unk> modern life 
 having just passed through one of the most profitable periods in their history these producers now see their prices eroding 
 pricing cycles to be sure are nothing new for plastics producers 
 and the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the <unk> period that is just behind them 
 we were all wonderful heroes last year says an executive at one of quantum 's competitors 
 now we 're at the bottom of the <unk> 
 at quantum which is based in new york the trouble is magnified by the company 's heavy <unk> on plastics 
 once known as national <unk> & chemical corp. the company <unk> the wine and spirits business and <unk> more of its resources into plastics after mr. <unk> took the chief executive 's job in N 
 mr. <unk> N years old declined to be interviewed for this article but he has consistently argued that over the long haul across both the <unk> and the <unk> of the plastics market quantum will <unk> through its new direction 
 quantum 's lot is mostly tied to polyethylene <unk> used to make garbage bags milk <unk> <unk> toys and meat packaging among other items 
 in the u.s. polyethylene market quantum has claimed the largest share about N N 
 but its competitors including dow chemical co. union carbide corp. and several oil giants have much broader business interests and so are better <unk> against price swings 
 when the price of polyethylene moves a mere penny a pound quantum 's annual profit <unk> by about N cents a share provided no other <unk> are changing 
 in recent months the price of polyethylene even more than that of other commodity plastics has taken a dive 
 benchmark grades which still sold for as much as N cents a pound last spring have skidded to between N cents and N cents 
 meanwhile the price of <unk> the chemical building block of polyethylene has n't dropped nearly so fast 
 that <unk> <unk> quantum badly because its own plants cover only about half of its <unk> needs 
 by many accounts an early hint of a price rout in the making came at the start of this year 
 china which had been putting in huge orders for polyethylene abruptly halted them 
 <unk> that excess polyethylene would soon be <unk> around the world other buyers then bet that prices had peaked and so began to draw down inventories rather than order new product 
 kenneth mitchell director of dow 's polyethylene business says producers were surprised to learn how much inventories had swelled throughout the distribution chain as prices <unk> up 
 people were even <unk> bags he says 
 now producers hope prices have hit bottom 
 they recently announced increases of a few cents a pound to take effect in the next several weeks 
 no one knows however whether the new posted prices will stick once producers and customers start to <unk> 
 one <unk> is george <unk> a <unk> analyst at oppenheimer & co. and a bear on plastics stocks 
 noting others ' estimates of when price increases can be sustained he remarks some say october 
 some say november 
 i say N 
 he argues that efforts to firm up prices will be undermined by producers ' plans to expand production capacity 
 a quick turnaround is crucial to quantum because its cash requirements remain heavy 
 the company is trying to carry out a three-year $ N billion <unk> program started this year 
 at the same time its annual payments on long-term debt will more than double from a year ago to about $ N million largely because of debt taken on to pay a $ <unk> special dividend earlier this year 
 quantum described the payout at the time as a way for it to share the <unk> with its holders because its stock price was n't reflecting the huge profit increases 
 some analysts saw the payment as an effort also to <unk> takeover speculation 
 whether a cash crunch might eventually force the company to cut its quarterly dividend raised N N to N cents a share only a year ago has become a topic of intense speculation on wall street since mr. <unk> <unk> dividend questions in a sept. N meeting with analysts 
 some viewed his response that company directors review the dividend regularly as nothing more than the standard line from executives 
 but others came away thinking he had given something less than his usual <unk> performance 
 in any case on the day of the meeting quantum 's shares slid $ N to $ N in big board trading 
 on top of everything else quantum <unk> a disaster at its plant in morris ill 
 after an explosion <unk> the plant in june the company <unk> in september to within N hours of completing the <unk> process of <unk> it 
 then a second explosion occurred 
 two workers died and six remain in the hospital 
 this human toll adds the most painful <unk> yet to the sudden change in quantum 's fortunes 
 until this year the company had been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking up <unk> safety <unk> 
 a prolonged production halt at the plant could introduce another <unk> into quantum 's financial future 
 when a plant has just been running flat out to meet demand <unk> lost profit and thus claims under <unk> insurance is <unk> 
 but the numbers become <unk> and subject to <unk> between insured and insurer when demand is shifting 
 you say you could have sold x percent of this product and <unk> percent of that recalls <unk> <unk> an analyst at shearson lehman hutton who went through this exercise during his former career as a chemical engineer 
 and then you still have to negotiate 
 quantum hopes the morris plant where limited production got under way last week will resume full operation by year 's end 
 the plant usually accounts for N N to N N of quantum 's polyethylene production and N N of its <unk> production 
 not everything looks grim for quantum 
 the plant expansion should strengthen the company 's <unk> in the polyethylene business where market share is often taken through sheer capacity 
 by lifting <unk> production the expansion will also lower the company 's raw material costs 
 quantum is also tightening its grip on its one large business outside chemicals propane marketing 
 through a venture with its investment banker first boston corp. quantum completed in august an acquisition of <unk> inc. in a transaction valued at $ N billion 
 <unk> is the second-largest propane distributor in the u.s. 
 the largest suburban propane was already owned by quantum 
 still quantum has a crisis to get past right now 
 some analysts speculate the weakening stock may yet attract a suitor 
 the name <unk> in rumors is british petroleum co. which is looking to expand its polyethylene business in the u.s. 
 asked about a bid for quantum a <unk> spokesman says we pretty much have a policy of not commenting on rumors and i think that falls in that category 
 rjr nabisco inc. is <unk> its division responsible for buying network advertising time just a month after moving N of the group 's N employees to new york from atlanta 
 a spokesman for the new york-based food and tobacco giant taken private earlier this year in a $ N billion leveraged buy-out by kohlberg kravis roberts & co. confirmed that it is <unk> down the rjr nabisco broadcast unit and <unk> its N employees in a move to save money 
 the spokesman said rjr is discussing its <unk> plans with its two main advertising firms <unk> katz and <unk> <unk> 
 we found with the size of our media purchases that an ad agency could do just as good a job at significantly lower cost said the spokesman who declined to specify how much rjr spends on network television time 
 an executive close to the company said rjr is spending about $ N million on network television time this year down from roughly $ N million last year 
 the spokesman said the broadcast unit will be <unk> dec. N and the move wo n't affect rjr 's print radio and <unk> buying practices 
 the broadcast group had been based in new york until a year ago when rjr 's previous management moved it to atlanta the company 's headquarters before this summer 
 one employee with the group said rjr moved N employees of the group back to new york in september because there was supposed to be a future 
 he said the company hired three more buyers for the unit within the past two weeks wooing them from jobs with advertising agencies 
 the rjr spokesman said the company moved the N employees to new york last month because the group had then been in the midst of purchasing ad time for the networks ' <unk> season 
 the studies on closing the unit could n't be completed until now he said 
 the group 's president peter <unk> was n't in his office friday afternoon to comment 
 the u.s. which is <unk> its <unk> quotas is <unk> a larger share of its steel market to developing and newly industrialized countries which have relatively <unk> steel industries 
 meanwhile the u.s. has negotiated a significant cut in japan 's steel quota and made only a minor increase to the steel <unk> for the european community 
 brazil similar to mexico and south korea is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the u.s. market than it had under the previous five-year steel quotas which expired sept. N 
 brazil and venezuela are the only two countries that have n't completed steel talks with the u.s. for the year ending oct. N N 
 in recent years u.s. steelmakers have supplied about N N of the N million tons of steel used annually by the nation 
 of the remaining N N needed the <unk> negotiations <unk> about N N to foreign suppliers with the difference supplied mainly by canada which is n't included in the quota program 
 other countries that do n't have formal steel quotas with the u.s. such as taiwan sweden and argentina also have supplied steel 
 some of these countries have in recent years made informal agreements with the u.s. that are similar to quotas 
 the bush administration earlier this year said it would extend steel quotas known as voluntary restraint agreements until march N N 
 it also said it would use that <unk> year period to work toward an international consensus on <unk> up the international steel trade which has been <unk> managed subsidized and protected by governments 
 the u.s. termed its plan a trade <unk> program despite the fact that it is merely an extension 
 mexico which was one of the first countries to conclude its steel talks with the u.s. virtually doubled its quota to N N of the u.s. steel market from N N under the previous quotas 
 south korea which had N N under the previous quotas is set to get a small increase to about N N 
 that increase rises to slightly more than N N of the u.s. market if a joint <unk> steel project is included 
 meanwhile brazil is expected to increase its allowance from the N N share it has had in recent years 
 the ec and japan the u.s. 's largest steel suppliers have n't been filling their quotas to the full extent 
 the ec steel industry which has been coping with strong european demand has been supplying about N N of the u.s. market compared with recent quotas of about N N 
 japan has been shipping steel to total about N N of the u.s. market compared with a quota of N N 
 in the recent talks the ec had its quota increased about N tons to N N of the u.s. market from N N in N 
 but its quota has been as high as N N in N 
 japan however has agreed to cut its quota to about N N from N N previously 
 japan the ec brazil mexico and south korea provide about N N of the steel imported to the u.s. under the quota program 
 the balance is supplied by a host of smaller exporters such as australia and venezuela 
 the u.s. had about an extra N N of the domestic steel market to give to foreign suppliers in its quota talks 
 that was essentially made up of a N N increase in the overall quota program and N N from cutting japan 's allowance 
 negotiators from the white house trade office will repeat these quota negotiations next year when they will have another N N of the u.s. steel market to <unk> 
 these <unk> <unk> increases to the steel quota program are built into the bush administration 's <unk> program to give its negotiators leverage with foreign steel suppliers to try to get them to withdraw subsidies and <unk> from their own steel industries 
 <unk> inc. expects fiscal second-quarter earnings to trail N results but anticipates that several new products will lead to a much stronger performance in its second half 
 <unk> a telecommunications company had net income of $ N or five cents a share in its year-earlier second quarter ended sept. N 
 revenue totaled $ N million 
 george <unk> chairman and chief executive officer said in an interview that earnings in the most recent quarter will be about two cents a share on revenue of just under $ N million 
 the lower results mr. <unk> said reflect a 12-month decline in industry sales of privately owned pay telephones <unk> 's primary business 
 although mr. <unk> expects that line of business to strengthen in the next year he said <unk> will also benefit from moving into other areas 
 <unk> among those is the company 's <unk> into the public facsimile business mr. <unk> said 
 within the next year <unk> expects to place N fax machines made by <unk> in japan in hotels municipal buildings <unk> and other public <unk> around the country 
 <unk> will provide a credit-card reader for the machines to collect store and forward billing data 
 mr. <unk> said <unk> should realize a minimum of $ N of <unk> net earnings for each machine each month 
 <unk> has also developed an automatic call <unk> that will make further use of the company 's system for <unk> and handling credit-card calls and collect calls 
 automatic call processors will provide that system for virtually any telephone mr. <unk> said not just phones produced by <unk> 
 the company will also be producing a new line of convenience telephones which do n't accept coins for use in hotel <unk> office <unk> <unk> <unk> and similar <unk> 
 mr. <unk> estimated that the processors and convenience phones would produce about $ N of <unk> net earnings for each machine each month

 <unk> medical inc. said it adopted a shareholders ' rights plan in which rights to purchase shares of common stock will be distributed as a dividend to shareholders of record as of oct. N 
 the company said the plan was n't adopted in response to any known offers for <unk> a maker and marketer of hospital products 
 the rights allow shareholders to purchase <unk> stock at a discount if any person or group acquires more than N N of the company 's common stock or <unk> a tender offer 
 measuring <unk> may soon be replaced by <unk> in the <unk> room 
 procter & gamble co. plans to begin testing next month a <unk> detergent that will require only a few <unk> per <unk> 
 the move stems from <unk> learned in japan where local competitors have had <unk> success with concentrated <unk> 
 it also marks p&g 's growing concern that its japanese rivals such as <unk> corp. may bring their <unk> to the u.s. 
 the cincinnati consumer-products giant got clobbered two years ago in japan when <unk> introduced a powerful detergent called attack which quickly won a N N stake in the japanese markets 
 they do n't want to get caught again says one industry <unk> 
 retailers in phoenix ariz. say p&g 's new <unk> detergent to be called <unk> with color guard will be on shelves in that market by early november 
 a p&g spokeswoman confirmed that shipments to phoenix started late last month 
 she said the company will study results from this market before expanding to others 
 <unk> are n't entirely new for p&g 
 the company introduced a <unk> <unk> <unk> in japan after watching the success of attack 
 when attack hit the shelves in N p&g 's share of the japanese market fell to about N N from more than N N 
 with the help of <unk> <unk> p&g 's share is now estimated to be N N 
 while the japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products the true test for p&g will be in the $ N billion u.s. detergent market where growth is slow and <unk> have gained <unk> over <unk> 
 the company may have chosen to market the product under the <unk> name since it 's already expanded its <unk> tide into N different <unk> including this year 's big hit tide with <unk> 
 with <unk> however it is n't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more many people tend to dump too much detergent into the <unk> machine <unk> that it takes a cup of <unk> to really clean the <unk> 
 in the early 1980s p&g tried to launch here a concentrated detergent under the <unk> brand name that it markets in europe 
 but the product which was n't as concentrated as the new <unk> <unk> in a market test in denver and was dropped 
 p&g and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on detergent and fabric <unk> <unk> in <unk> but they have n't sold well despite the convenience 
 but p&g contends the new <unk> is a unique formula that also offers an <unk> that prevents colors from <unk> 
 and retailers are expected to <unk> the product in part because it will take up less shelf space 
 when shelf space was cheap bigger was better says <unk> <unk> an analyst at salomon <unk> 
 but with so many brands <unk> for space that 's no longer the case 
 if the new <unk> sells well the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own <unk> 
 then retailers will probably push the <unk> brands out altogether he says 
 competition is bound to get tougher if <unk> <unk> a product like attack in the u.s. 
 to be sure <unk> would n't have an easy time taking u.s. market share away from the mighty p&g which has about N N of the market 
 <unk> officials previously have said they are interested in selling <unk> in the u.s. but so far the company has focused on acquisitions such as last year 's purchase of andrew <unk> co. a cincinnati <unk> maker 
 it also has a <unk> facility in california 
 some believe p&g 's interest in a <unk> detergent goes beyond the concern for the japanese 
 this is something p&g would do with or without <unk> says mr. <unk> 
 with economic tension between the u.s. and japan worsening many japanese had feared last week 's visit from u.s. trade representative carla hills 
 they expected a new <unk> of demands that japan do something quickly to reduce its trade surplus with the u.s. 
 instead they got a discussion of the need for the u.s. and japan to work together and of the importance of the long-term view 
 mrs. hills ' first trip to japan as america 's chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month 's visit by commerce secretary robert a. mosbacher 
 mr. mosbacher called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental japanese business practices that supposedly inhibit free trade 
 he said such results should be <unk> in dollars and cents in reducing the u.s. trade deficit with japan 
 but mrs. hills speaking at a breakfast meeting of the american chamber of commerce in japan on saturday stressed that the objective is not to get definitive action by spring or summer it is rather to have a blueprint for action 
 she added that she expected perhaps to have a down payment some small step to convince the american people and the japanese people that we 're moving in <unk> 
 how such remarks translate into policy wo n't become clear for months 
 american and japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach <unk> mr. mosbacher and mrs. hills 
 many called it simply a contrast in styles 
 but some saw it as a classic negotiating <unk> 
 others said the bush administration may feel the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand 
 and some said it reflected the growing debate in washington over pursuing free trade with japan <unk> some kind of managed trade 
 asked to compare her visit to mr. mosbacher 's mrs. hills replied i did n't hear every word he spoke but as a general proposition i think we have a very consistent trade strategy in the bush administration 
 yet more than one american official who sat in with her during three days of talks with japanese officials said her tone often was surprisingly <unk> 
 i think my line has been very consistent mrs. hills said at a news conference saturday afternoon 
 i am painted sometimes as <unk> perhaps because i have a <unk> list of statutes to implement 
 i do n't feel very <unk> 
 i do n't feel either hard or soft 
 i feel committed to the program of opening markets and expanding trade 
 when she met the local press for the first time on friday mrs. hills firmly reiterated the need for progress in removing barriers to trade in forest products <unk> and <unk> three areas targeted under the <unk> N provision of the N trade bill 
 she <unk> <unk> business practices that the u.s. government has identified 
 but her main thrust was to promote the importance of world-wide free trade and open competition 
 she said the trade <unk> was mainly due to <unk> factors and should n't be <unk> by setting <unk> targets 
 at her news conference for japanese reporters one economics journalist <unk> up the japanese sense of relief 
 my impression was that you would be a scary old lady he said drawing a few nervous <unk> from his colleagues 
 but i am relieved to see that you are beautiful and <unk> and <unk> and a person of integrity 
 mrs. hills ' remarks did raise questions at least among some u.s. officials about what exactly her stance is on u.s. access to the japanese semiconductor market 
 the u.s. share of the japanese market has been stuck around N N for years 
 many americans have interpreted a N agreement as <unk> u.s. companies a N N share by N but the japanese have denied making any such promise 
 at one of her news conferences mrs. hills said i believe we can do much better than N N

 traditional industries inc. said it expects to report a net loss for the fourth quarter that ended june N and is seeking new financing 
 the seller of photographic products and services said it is considering a number of financing alternatives including seeking increases in its credit lines 
 traditional declined to estimate the amount of the loss and would n't say if it expects to show a profit for the year 
 in the year ended june N N traditional reported net income of $ N million or $ N a share 
 the company did n't break out its fourth-quarter results 
 in the latest nine months net income was $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N million 
 separately the company said it would file a delayed <unk> report with the securities and exchange commission within approximately N days 
 it said the delay resulted from difficulties in <unk> its accounting of a settlement with the federal trade commission 
 under an agreement filed in federal court in august to settle ftc objections to some traditional sales practices traditional said it would establish a $ N trust fund to provide refunds to certain customers 
 information international inc. said it was sued by a buyer of its computerized <unk> system alleging that the company failed to correct deficiencies in the system 
 a spokesman for information international said the lawsuit by two units of morris communications corp. seeks <unk> of the system 's about $ N million purchase price and cancellation of a software license provided by the morris units to information international for alleged failure to pay royalties 
 information international said it believes that the complaints filed in federal court in georgia are without merit 
 closely held morris communications is based in <unk> <unk> 
 the units that filed the suit are <unk> newspapers corp. and florida publishing co 
 <unk> corp. completed the sale of its a. <unk> & co. subsidiary a men 's luxury <unk> to <unk> investments 
 terms were n't disclosed 
 as <unk> 's core business of <unk> retailing grows a small subsidiary that is <unk> unrelated becomes a difficult <unk> said <unk> <unk> president of the parent in a statement

 the oil industry 's <unk> profits could <unk> through the rest of the year 
 major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability 
 the gasoline picture may improve this quarter but chemicals are likely to remain weak industry executives and analysts say reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance 
 the industry is seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals glenn cox president of phillips petroleum co. said in an interview 
 that change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings for the industry in general he added 
 he did n't forecast phillips 's results 
 but securities analysts say phillips will be among the companies <unk> by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third-quarter earnings 
 so too many analysts predict will exxon corp. chevron corp. and amoco corp 
 typical is what happened to the price of <unk> a major commodity chemical produced in vast amounts by many oil companies 
 it has plunged N N since july to around N cents a pound 
 a year ago <unk> sold for N cents <unk> at about N cents last december 
 a big reason for the chemical price retreat is <unk> 
 beginning in <unk> prices began accelerating as a growing u.s. economy and the weak dollar spurred demand 
 companies added capacity <unk> 
 now greatly increased supplies are on the market while the dollar is stronger and domestic economic growth is slower 
 third-quarter profits from gasoline were weaker 
 refining margins were so good in the third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year said william <unk> a securities analyst at first boston corp 
 oil company refineries ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in july and august that did n't <unk> 
 the excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period 
 in addition crude oil prices were up some from a year earlier further <unk> profitability 
 refiners say margins picked up in september and many industry officials believe gasoline profits will rebound this quarter though still not to the level of N 's fourth quarter 
 during the N second half many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits 
 crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising element of companies ' earnings this year 
 prices averaging roughly $ N a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier have stayed well above most companies ' expectations 
 demand has been much stronger than anticipated and it typically <unk> in the fourth quarter 
 we could see higher oil prices this year said <unk> <unk> an analyst at painewebber inc 
 that will translate into sharply higher production profits particularly compared with last year when oil prices steadily fell to below $ N a barrel in the fourth quarter 
 while oil prices have been better than expected natural gas prices have been worse 
 in the third quarter they averaged about N N less than they were in N 
 the main reason remains weather 
 last summer was notable for a heat wave and drought that caused utilities to <unk> more natural gas to feed increased electrical demand from air <unk> use 
 this summer on the other hand had <unk> weather than usual 
 we 've been very disappointed in the performance of natural gas prices said mr. cox phillips 's president 
 the lagging gas price is not going to assist fourth quarter performance as many had expected 
 going into the fourth quarter natural gas prices are anywhere from N N to N N lower than a year earlier 
 for instance natural gas currently produced along the gulf coast is selling on the spot market for around $ N a thousand cubic feet down N N from $ N a thousand cubic feet a year ago 
 the bush administration trying to blunt growing demands from western europe for a <unk> of controls on exports to the soviet bloc is questioning whether italy 's <unk> c. olivetti & co. supplied <unk> valuable technology to the soviets 
 most of the western european members of <unk> committee on <unk> export controls the <unk> forum through which the u.s. and its allies <unk> their <unk> policies are expected to argue for more liberal export rules at a meeting to be held in paris oct. N and N 
 they plan to press specifically for a <unk> of rules governing exports of machine tools computers and other high-technology products 
 but the bush administration says it wants to see evidence that all cocom members are <unk> fully with existing <unk> procedures before it will support further <unk> 
 to make its point it is challenging the italian government to explain reports that olivetti may have supplied the soviet union with sophisticated computer-driven devices that could be used to build parts for combat aircraft 
 the london sunday times which first reported the u.s. concerns cited a u.s. intelligence report as the source of the allegations that olivetti exported $ N million in <unk> <unk> flexible manufacturing systems to the soviet aviation industry 
 olivetti reportedly began shipping these tools in N 
 a state department spokesman acknowledged that the u.s. is discussing the allegations with the italian government and cocom but declined to confirm any details 
 italian president <unk> <unk> promised a quick investigation into whether olivetti broke cocom rules 
 president bush called his attention to the matter during the italian leader 's visit here last week 
 olivetti has denied that it violated cocom rules <unk> that the reported shipments were properly licensed by the italian authorities 
 although the <unk> of these sales is still an open question the disclosure could n't be better <unk> to support the position of <unk> <unk> in the pentagon and the intelligence community 
 it seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important cocom meeting said a washington lobbyist for a number of u.s. computer companies 
 the bush administration has sent <unk> signals about its <unk> policies reflecting <unk> divisions among several competing agencies 
 last summer mr. bush moved the administration in the direction of gradual <unk> when he told a north atlantic treaty organization meeting that he would allow some exceptions to the cocom <unk> of strategic goods 
 but more recently the pentagon and the commerce department openly <unk> over the extent to which cocom should <unk> exports of personal computers to the bloc 
 however these agencies generally agree that the west should be cautious about any further <unk> 
 there 's no evidence that the soviet program to illegally acquire western technology has diminished said a state department spokesman 
 salomon brothers international ltd. a british subsidiary of salomon inc. announced it will issue warrants on shares of hong kong telecommunications ltd 
 the move closely follows a similar offer by salomon of warrants for shares of <unk> & shanghai banking corp 
 under the latest offer hk$ N million us$ N million of three-year warrants will be issued in london each giving buyers the right to buy one hong kong telecommunications share at a price to be determined friday 
 the N million warrants will be priced at hk$ N each and are expected to carry a premium to the share price of about N N 
 in trading on the stock exchange of hong kong the shares closed wednesday at hk$ N each 
 at this price the shares would have to rise above hk$ N for subscribers to salomon 's issue to profitably convert their warrants 
 while hong kong companies have in the past issued warrants on their own shares salomon 's warrants are the first here to be issued by a third party 
 salomon will cover the warrants by buying sufficient shares or options to purchase shares to cover its entire position 
 bankers said warrants for hong kong stocks are attractive because they give foreign investors wary of volatility in the colony 's stock market an opportunity to buy shares without taking too great a risk 
 the hong kong telecommunications warrants should be attractive to buyers in europe the bankers added because the group is one of a handful of blue-chip stocks on the hong kong market that has international appeal

 in a suit filed in federal court thursday the s&l alleged that a disproportionate number of the bonds it purchased in N declined in value 
 financial corp. purchased the bonds the suit alleged after mr. boesky and drexel negotiated an agreement for <unk> hotels to purchase a N N stake in the thrift for about $ N million 
 <unk> hotels was controlled by mr. boesky who currently is serving a prison term for securities violations

 shortly before the visit mr. boesky and drexel <unk> had met with financial corp. officials and had signed a letter of intent to acquire the N N stake in the company

 ideal 's directors rejected that offer although they said they endorsed the merger proposal 
 under the agreement <unk> will own N N of the combined company 
 ideal 's current operations will represent about N N of the combined company 
 the transaction is subject to a definitive agreement and approval by ideal shareholders 
 ideal said it expects to complete the transaction early next year 
 while corn and soybean prices have slumped well below their <unk> <unk> of N wheat prices remain <unk> high 
 and they 're likely to stay that way for months to come analysts say 
 for one thing even with many farmers <unk> more winter wheat this year than last tight wheat supplies are likely to support prices well into N the analysts say 
 and if rain does n't fall soon across many of the great plains ' <unk> areas yields in the crop now being planted could be reduced further <unk> supplies 
 also supporting prices are expectations that the soviet union will place substantial buying orders over the next few months 
 by next may N stocks of u.s. wheat to be carried over into the next season before the winter wheat now being planted is <unk> are projected to drop to N million <unk> 
 that would be the lowest level since the early 1970s 
 stocks were N million <unk> on may N of this year 
 in response to <unk> domestic supplies agriculture secretary <unk> <unk> last month said the u.s. government would slightly increase the number of acres farmers can plant in wheat for next year and still qualify for federal support payments 
 the government estimates that the new plan will boost production next year by about N million <unk> 
 it now estimates production for next year at just under N billion <unk> compared with this year 's estimated N billion and a <unk> N billion in N 
 but the full effect on prices of the winter wheat now being planted wo n't be felt until the second half of next year 
 until then limited stocks are likely to keep prices near the $ <unk> level analysts say 
 on the chicago board of trade friday wheat for december delivery settled at $ N a bushel unchanged 
 in theory at least tight supplies next spring could leave the wheat futures market susceptible to a <unk> squeeze said daniel <unk> a futures analyst with <unk> co. in chicago 
 such a situation can <unk> havoc as was shown by the emergency that developed in soybean futures trading this summer on the chicago board of trade 
 in july the <unk> ordered <unk> <unk> s.p a. to liquidate futures positions equal to about N million <unk> of soybeans 
 the exchange said it feared that some members would n't be able to find enough soybeans to deliver and would have to default on their <unk> obligation to the italian conglomerate which had refused requests to reduce its holdings 
 <unk> has denied it was trying to manipulate the soybean futures market 
 <unk> hot dry weather across large portions of the great plains and in <unk> areas in washington and oregon is threatening to reduce the yield from this season 's winter wheat crop said <unk> leslie a futures analyst and head of leslie analytical in chicago 
 for example in the oklahoma <unk> N N or more of the <unk> is short of <unk> 
 that figure <unk> to about N N in <unk> portions of kansas he said 
 the soviet union has n't given any clear indication of its wheat purchase plans but many analysts expect moscow to place sizable orders for u.s. wheat in the next few months further supporting prices 
 wheat prices will increasingly <unk> off of soviet demand in coming weeks predicted richard <unk> vice president research for <unk> inc. in chicago 
 looking ahead to other commodity markets this week 
 orange <unk> traders will be watching to see how long and how far the price decline that began friday will go 
 late thursday after the close of trading the market received what would normally have been a bullish u.s. department of agriculture estimate of the N florida orange crop 
 it was near the low range of estimates at N million <unk> boxes compared with N million boxes last season 
 however as expected brazil waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its <unk> concentrate to about $ N a pound from around $ N 
 friday 's <unk> selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the u.s. report might have had and sent the november orange <unk> contract down as much as N cents a pound at one time 
 it settled with a loss of N cents at $ N a pound 
 brazilian <unk> after a delay caused by drought at the start of its crop season is beginning to arrive in the u.s. in large quantities 
 brazil wants to stimulate demand for its product which is going to be in <unk> supply 
 the price cut one analyst said appeared to be aimed even more at europe where consumption of brazilian <unk> has fallen 
 it 's a <unk> product and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in europe the analyst said 
 new york futures prices have dropped significantly from more than $ N a pound at midyear 
 barring a cold <unk> or other crop problems in the growing areas downward pressure on prices is likely to continue into january when <unk> and processing of <unk> in florida reach their peak the analyst said 
 energy 
 although some analysts look for profit-taking in the wake of friday 's leap in crude oil prices last week 's rally is generally expected to continue this week 
 i would continue to look for a stable crude market at least in futures trading said william <unk> an energy futures broker with <unk> & co 
 friday capped a week of steadily rising crude oil prices in both futures and spot markets 
 on the new york mercantile exchange west texas intermediate crude for november delivery finished at $ N a barrel up N cents on the day 
 on european markets meanwhile spot prices of north sea <unk> were up N to N cents a barrel 
 this market still wants to go higher said <unk> <unk> a first vice president at shearson lehman hutton inc 
 he predicted that the november contract will reach $ N a barrel or more on the new york mercantile exchange 
 there has been little news to account for such <unk> in the oil markets 
 analysts generally cite a lack of bearish developments as well as rumors of a possible tightening of supplies of some fuels and <unk> 
 there also are <unk> reports that the soviet union is having difficulties with its oil exports and that <unk> has about reached its production limit and ca n't produce as much as it could sell 
 many traders <unk> a tightening of near-term supplies particularly of high-quality <unk> such as those produced in the north sea and in <unk> 
 if a hostile <unk> emerges for saatchi & saatchi co. <unk> charles and maurice saatchi will lead a management buy-out attempt an official close to the company said 
 financing for any takeover attempt may be <unk> in the wake of friday 's stock-market sell-off in new york and turmoil in the junk-bond market 
 but the beleaguered british advertising and consulting giant which last week named a new chief executive officer to replace maurice saatchi has been the subject of intense takeover speculation for weeks 
 last week saatchi 's largest shareholder <unk> asset management said it had been approached by one or more third parties interested in a possible restructuring 
 and carl spielvogel chief executive officer of saatchi 's big backer spielvogel bates advertising unit said he had offered to lead a management buy-out of the company but was rebuffed by charles saatchi 
 mr. spielvogel said he would n't launch a hostile bid 
 the executive close to saatchi & saatchi said that if a bidder came up with a <unk> high offer a crazy offer which saatchi knew it could n't beat it would have no choice but to recommend it to shareholders 
 but otherwise it would undoubtedly come back with an offer by management 
 the executive said any buy-out would be led by the current board whose chairman is maurice saatchi and whose strategic <unk> force is believed to be charles saatchi 
 mr. spielvogel is n't part of the board nor are any of the other heads of saatchi 's big <unk> ad agencies 
 the executive did n't name any price but securities analysts have said saatchi would fetch upward of $ N billion 
 the executive denied speculation that saatchi was bringing in the new chief executive officer only to clean up the company financially so that the brothers could lead a buy-back 
 that speculation <unk> friday as industry executives <unk> the appointment of the new chief executive robert <unk> who joins saatchi and becomes a member of its board on jan. N 
 mr. <unk> formerly chief executive of the pharmaceutical research firm <unk> international inc. has a reputation as a <unk> financial manager and will be charged largely with <unk> saatchi 's poor financial state 
 asked about the speculation that mr. <unk> has been hired to <unk> the way for a buy-out by the brothers the executive replied that is n't the reason dreyfus has been brought in 
 he was brought in to turn around the company 
 separately several saatchi agency clients said they believe the company 's management <unk> will have little affect on them 
 it has n't had any impact on us nor do we expect it to said a spokeswoman for miller brewing co. a major client of backer spielvogel 
 john <unk> director of advertising at painewebber inc. a saatchi & saatchi advertising client said we have no problem with the announcement because we do n't know what change it 's going to bring about 
 we are n't going to change agencies because of a change in london 
 executives at backer spielvogel client <unk> inc. as well as at saatchi client <unk> lighting co. also said they saw no effect 
 executives at prudential-bache securities inc. a backer spielvogel client that is reviewing its account declined comment

 newspaper publishers are reporting mixed third-quarter results aided by favorable newsprint prices and hampered by flat or declining advertising <unk> especially in the northeast 
 adding to <unk> in the industry seasonal retail ad spending patterns in newspapers have been upset by shifts in ownership and general <unk> within the retail industry 
 in new york the <unk> teller and b. altman & co. department stores have filed for protection from creditors under chapter N of the federal bankruptcy code while the r.h. macy & co. bloomingdale 's and saks fifth avenue department-store chains are for sale 
 many papers throughout the country are also faced with a slowdown in <unk> spending a booming category for newspapers in recent years 
 until recently industry analysts believed <unk> in retail ad spending had <unk> out and would in fact increase in this year 's third and fourth quarters 
 all bets are off analysts say because of the shifting ownership of the retail chains 
 improved paper prices will help offset weakness in <unk> but the retailers ' problems have affected the amount of ad <unk> they usually run said edward j. <unk> industry analyst for salomon brothers inc 
 retailers are just in disarray 
 for instance <unk> co. posted an N N gain in net income as total ad pages dropped at usa today but advertising revenue rose because of a higher circulation rate base and increased rates 
 <unk> 's N daily and N <unk> newspapers reported a N N increase in advertising and circulation revenue 
 total advertising <unk> was modestly lower as <unk> volume increased while there was softer demand for retail and national ad <unk> said john <unk> <unk> 's chief executive officer 
 at usa today ad pages totaled N for the quarter down N N from the N period which was helped by increased ad spending from the summer olympics 
 while usa today 's total paid ad pages for the year to date totaled N a decrease of N N from last year the paper 's ad revenue increased N N in the quarter and N N in the nine months 
 in the nine months <unk> 's net rose N N to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share 
 revenue gained N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 at dow jones & co. third-quarter net income fell N N from the year-earlier period 
 net fell to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or N cents a share 
 the year-earlier period included a one-time gain of $ N million or four cents a share 
 revenue gained N N to $ N million from $ N million 
 the drop in profit reflected in part continued softness in financial advertising at the wall street journal and barron 's magazine 
 ad <unk> at the journal fell N N in the third quarter 
 affiliated publications inc. reversed a year-earlier third quarter net loss 
 the publisher of the boston globe reported net of $ N million or N cents a share compared with a loss of $ N million or N cents a share for the third quarter in N 
 william o. taylor the parent 's chairman and chief executive officer said earnings continued to be hurt by softness in ad volume at the boston newspaper 
 third-quarter profit estimates for several companies are being strongly affected by the price of newsprint which in the last two years has had several price increases 
 after a supply crunch caused prices to rise N N since N to $ N a metric ton analysts are encouraged because they do n't expect a price increase for the rest of this year 
 companies with daily newspapers in the northeast will need the stable newsprint prices to ease damage from weak ad <unk> 
 mr. <unk> at salomon brothers said he estimates that times mirror co. 's earnings were down for the third quarter because of soft advertising levels at its long island <unk> and hartford <unk> newspapers 
 trouble on the east coast was likely offset by improved ad <unk> at the los angeles times which this week also unveiled a <unk> 
 new york times co. is expected to report lower earnings for the third quarter because of continued weak advertising levels at its flagship new york times and deep discounting of newsprint at its affiliate forest products group 
 times co. 's regional daily newspapers are holding up well but there is little sign that things will improve in the new york market said alan <unk> an analyst with shearson lehman hutton 
 washington post co. is expected to report improved earnings largely because of increased cable revenue and publishing revenue helped by an improved retail market in the washington area 
 according to analysts profits were also helped by successful cost-cutting measures at newsweek 
 the <unk> has faced heightened competition from rival time magazine and a relatively flat magazine advertising market 
 knight-ridder inc. is faced with continued uncertainty over the pending joint operating agreement between its detroit free press and <unk> 's detroit news and has told analysts that earnings were down in the third quarter 
 however analysts point to positive advertising spending at several of its major daily newspapers such as miami herald and san jose
